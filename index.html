                <p>I want to say this the way I should’ve said it from the start:<br>
                    I was wrong.</p>

                <p>When I was getting close to you,<br>
                    I was still in a relationship I should’ve ended earlier.<br>
                    I told myself I was already leaving…<br>
                    but the truth is, it wasn’t over yet.<br>
                    And that made what I did unfair to her, and especially to you.</p>

                <p>You didn’t deserve to be pulled into something unfinished.<br>
                    You didn’t deserve uncertainty.<br>
                    And you didn’t deserve to question whether I might hurt you someday the same way.</p>

                <p>Your fear makes sense.<br>
                    Your disappointment makes sense.<br>
                    Your distance makes sense.</p>

                <p>I’m not here to explain it away.<br>
                    I’m here to acknowledge exactly what I failed to do:<br>
                    to be honest, clean, and fully free before choosing someone new.</p>

                <p>I’m not asking you to trust me right now.<br>
                    I’m not asking for forgiveness,<br>
                    and I’m not asking for a relationship.</p>

                <p>I just want to take responsibility <br>
                    clearly, quietly, and without pressure.</p>

                <p>Thank you for giving this a moment.<br>
                    Even reading this is more grace than I deserve.</p>
